    For Week 5, we have to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

# About the Project

## Requirements: User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Requirements: Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements for this week's portfolio work:

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

### Built With

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
* [Bootstrap v4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome v5.8.1](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [JS](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [JQuery v3.2.1](https://jquery.com/)
* [Moment.js v2.24.0](https://momentjs.com/)


This week, I inserted Bootstrap, Moment.js and javascipt elements to complete the starter code. Once a user hits the save icon, the task will be stored in local storage and will be restored upon refresh.
